##Food Insecurity Challenge

**How do we get an actionable picture of food insecurity at the
community and county level and build solutions to better tackle this
important issue?**

**THE PROBLEM:**

[Many California families are eating a nutritionally poor diet or going
hungry](http://www.cafoodbanks.org/hunger-factsheet). According to
figures from 2014, there are [5.4 million
Californians](http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/our-research/map-the-meal-gap/2014/CA_AllCounties_CDs_MMG_2014.pdf)
that are food insecure – meaning they have uncertain access to enough
food to eat. Many of these individuals are children. For children, not
having enough of the right kinds of foods can have [serious implications
for a child’s physical and mental health, academic achievement and
future economic
prosperity](http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/impact-of-hunger/child-hunger/?_ga=1.257625358.420389359.1464286163).
How do we connect these families with the rich agricultural bounty of
our State?

**What is food insecurity?**

The United States Department of Agriculture [defines food
insecurity](http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/measurement.aspx#insecurity)
as limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe
foods, or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in
socially acceptable ways.

-   In 2014, California’s food insecurity rate was 13.9%, with some
    counties reporting rates at 18%, and Siskiyou county reporting the
    [highest rate of
    20](http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/our-research/map-the-meal-gap/2014/CA_AllCounties_CDs_MMG_2014.pdf)%.

-   The food insecurity of California households with children ages 0 to
    17 increased from 11.7 percent in 2000-2002 to 15.6 percent
    in 2010-2012. (California Department of Public Health: [Portrait of
    Promise](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Documents/CDPHOHEDisparityReportAug2015.pdf))

-   Combined 5.4 million Californians were reported as food insecure.

One of the Let’s Get Healthy California indicators that relates to Food
Security is [access to fruits and
vegetables](https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/goals/creating-healthy-communities/increasing-access-to-healthy-food-outlets/).
Fruits and vegetables are the cornerstone of a healthy diet, providing
macro and micronutrients, fiber, and other natural substances that a
body needs to stay healthy.

Over one-third of adults in California reported that they seldom, never,
or only sometimes could find a variety of good quality, affordable fresh
fruits and vegetables that they want in their neighborhood. Significant
differences in access to healthy foods were also found when examined
by[race/ethnicity](https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/progress/understanding-this-data/#race-ethnicity),
education, and geography.

This is magnified for low-income families in particular who must often
travel miles from their neighborhood to purchase healthy foods at
reasonable prices These families often live in neighborhoods referred to
as “food swamps,” or areas that have an abundance of cheap,
low-nutrient, high-calorie food, but provide limited access to the fresh
fruits and vegetables our State supplies in vast quantity to the rest of
the nation.

**THE CHALLENGE: **

**We are calling all data enthusiasts and innovators to help us better
tackle food insecurity challenges. **

**Telling the story using** **data**

> There are many different, scattered sources and types of data that are
> part of a potential picture of food insecurity. How might we bring
> this data together in a way that becomes actionable to support local
> communities in targeting interventions and making resources available
> where they are needed most?

**Leverage data and technology to build solutions**

> How might we harness these data to build solutions that empower
> communities to access available resources and better tackle food
> insecurity challenges?
