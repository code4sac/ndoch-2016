# Community Health Needs and Priorities Challenge

Calling all innovators to harness data and technology to develop a
concept or a tool that would allow communities to build an evolving
list/dialogue with their government about health and wellbeing needs and
priorities**

## The Challenge

Imagine a place where government can leverage data and information from
communities and external partners while enabling discussions,
encouraging collaborations, and sharing skills. This space/solution
would allow for communities to share needs, ideas, provide insight, and
leverage lessons learned around specific areas of focus.

## What do we want to achieve?

In order for us to collectively improve the health and wellbeing of all
Californians, we must set bigger goals, use bolder strategies and be
better partners. We want this space/solution to stimulate innovation and
ultimately, shape our programs and services, help provide input on
priorities, and improve public policy.

The ultimate goal is to connect communities and government in an open
feedback loop. By opening lines of communication and building a bridge
between civic tech, communities, and government we will bring together
the people that hold different pieces of the larger puzzle to help
design solutions and move the needle on the specific health and human
services issues:

-   **Civic technologists/coders** know how to build apps and
    visualizations, but they may lack an insight regarding specific
    real-world health and human services issues.

-   **Community members** and community partners who face health issues
    every day and are eager to share insights around these challenges
    and needs and help design solutions that will address them.

-   **Government staff** can benefit from further insight on the
    community health priorities and specific needs that need to
    be solved.

**We are challenging you to envision the solution that will connect
government staff with the people experiencing the need as well as civic
tech community who have tools to help build solutions around these
needs. The platform where people can pose challenges or problems,
advertise skill sets, volunteer their particular skills to solving posed
problems, discuss relevant issues, and leverage data to produce better
program and policy outcomes.**

**As a part of this challenge you might provide input on specific
community need (as a use case) and specific data that might help address
that need.**

> The State has a wealth of data, and the [CHHS Open Data
> Program](https://chhs.data.ca.gov) is working to make these data
> available in open formats.
>
> Given the data available, what other data would the public like to
> see?
>
> What is the compelling community need or use case for prioritizing the
> publishing of these data? How can data on the portal be improved?

## Resources and Inspiration

[**Let's Get Healthy California**](https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/)

In 2012 California leaders in health and healthcare from the public
and private sectors came together to develop a ten year plan to make
California the healthiest state in the nation. They identified six
goal areas and key indicators to measure our progress towards this
goal of becoming the healthiest state in the nation.

Let’s Get Healthy California’s goal areas and indicators highlight a
broad health and health care areas of focus. These broad areas of
focus are a lens and a pipeline though which to engage the public,
hone in, capture and understand specific community need and area of
opportunity.

Let’s Get Healthy California happens through collective impact; sharing and inspiring ideas, and connecting people, stories, and data.

>“This is a very bottom-up effort where we want to provide the tools,
> and the resources, and hopefully the inspiration for people to take
> charge of their own health – because at the end of the day, that’s
> really what has to happen.” - Secretary Diana Dooley

In 2016 CHHS launched [Let’s Get Health California interactive
website](http://www.letsgethealthy.ca.gov) to engage citizens in
sharing insights and designing solutions that will transform the
health of our state.

[**CHHS Open Data Portal**](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/)

Since its launch in 2014, 12 CHHS departments have published close to
200 dataset on the [CHHS Open Data Portal](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/).
Open Data has provided the common ground for thoughtful engagement
with external resource partners to support our goals and objectives.
It has been the catalyst for the departments to start thinking about
how government can more effectively engage and interact with people to
drive and inform our work; how we design our programs and services and
create more efficient programs that provide better results for the
people we serve.

[**Demand-Driven Open Data (DDOD)**](http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/projects-item/demand-driven-open-data/)

While a seamless resource connecting data, people, and use cases may
be a vision of the near future, the concept is already being explored
and the case is being made for innovation driven open data at the
federal and local levels. The Health and Human Services Idea Lab is
pioneering a [Demand-Driven Open
Data ](http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/projects-item/demand-driven-open-data/)(DDOD)
program, where they are working to provide systematic and sustainable
two way conversations between data users and data providers. This will
hopefully allow the government to prioritize the data it makes
available to users based on their expressed needs.

[**Open Opportunities**](http://www.digitalgov.gov/join-digitalgov/open-opportunities-in-digitalgov/)

Open Opportunities is creating a network of federal employees that will lead to a more effective, efficient, responsive government by sharing skills and collaborating on projects that support the mission of an agency or the government as a whole.

OpenOpps is the open source platform that supports the Open Opportunities program. As open source software, it can be deployed by state or local governments or in the private sector. It is free to use by anyone who can has technical operations staff and passion to start a new program, and we welcome everyone who would like to contribute to improving the platform.

[**San Francisco’s Open DataSF**](http://datasf.org/)

Another example here in California is [San Francisco’s
DataSF](http://datasf.org/) program, where citizens can access the
city’s data portal, have conversations about the city’s data and view
use cases, apps, and visualizations created with the data. These
examples illustrate how people are using data today, and sets the
stage for taking the potential of open data to the next level.

[**City of Philadelphia Open Data**](http://www.phila.gov/data/)

The City of Philadelphia has created several pathways to engage
constituents.

- [Discussion Board](http://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/slash-data/discuss/) allows
anyone to post a question or comment on the Open Data Philly
discussion group.
- [Data Inventory](http://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/slash-data/inventory/)
is a detailed list of every dataset that exists within city government
with imbedded commenting featurethat helps gauge public demand and
inform prioritization of data releases.
- [Data Inventory Publication Schedule](https://trello.com/b/iUUy84lK/deprecated-city-of-philadelphia-open-data-pipeline)
provides visibility into the city of Philadelphia’s data release
\schedule and allows for public to comment and provide feedback.
